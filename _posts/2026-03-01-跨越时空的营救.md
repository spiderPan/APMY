# 跨越时空的营救

## Page 1 - The Smothering Blanket / 窒息的毯子

### Visual: A sepia-toned illustration. Inside the dark wagon, Mary and Laura are huddled under a heavy blanket. Outside, the wagon is tilted dangerously in the rushing, white-capped water. You can see the "three heads" struggling in the current

| 河水涨得飞快，瞬间变成了一堵翻滚的水墙。在大篷车里，妈妈用一条厚重的毯子紧紧捂住劳拉和玛丽。“别动！”她说。劳拉感觉到车厢升起并开始摇晃——车竟然漂起来了！她听见激烈的拍水声、呐喊声，接着是可怕的寂静，因为爸爸跳进河里去牵马了。在很长一段时间里，她们都迷失在汹涌的流水声中。

当车轮终于撞击到地面，爬上陡峭的岸边时，她们安全了。爸爸站在那儿，大口喘着气，全身不停地滴水。但当劳拉回头望向那条可怕的河流时，一股寒意袭上心头。“噢，杰克在哪儿？”她大声哭喊。杰克不见了。| The creek rose fast, a churning wall of water. Inside the wagon, Ma pulled a smothering blanket over Laura and Mary. "Don't move!" she said. Laura felt the wagon lift and sway—it was floating! She heard the splashing, the shouting, and then the terrifying silence as Pa jumped into the river to lead the horses. For a long, long time, they were lost in the noise of the rushing water.

When the wheels finally struck the ground and they climbed the steep bank, they were safe. Pa stood panting and dripping. But as Laura looked back at the terrible river, a cold feeling hit her stomach. "Oh, where’s Jack?" she cried. Jack was gone. |

## Page 2 - The Heart-Signal / 心灵信号

### Visual: The sepia world begins to blend with bright blue and orange light. April is shown holding the book, her eyes wide with sadness. In the background, the Paw Patrol Lookout is reacting to a "glow" coming from the book itself

|跨越一百年的时光，April仿佛正和劳拉一起躲在在那条厚毯子下。她能感觉到车厢的摇晃，能听到湍急的水声。当她读到杰克失踪的那一页时，她的内心发出了一个如此明亮的信号，甚至照亮了冒险湾的汪汪队总部！

“莱德！一个救援请求来自……一本书？”天天叫道。莱德检查了屏幕：“是April！她对故事的热爱开启了一条通往过去的路径。杰克在大溪流中遇到了麻烦，只有我们能听到她的呼唤。汪汪队，总部集合！”| Across a hundred years, April was right there under the blanket with Laura. She could feel the wagon swaying and hear the rushing water. When she reached the part where Jack was lost, her heart sent out a signal so bright it lit up the Lookout in Adventure Bay!

"Ryder! A rescue call is coming from... a book?" Skye barked. Ryder checked his screen. "It's April! Her love for the story has opened a path to the past. Jack is in trouble in the Big Creek, and only we can hear her call. Paw Patrol, to the Lookout!" |

|传送门就在咆哮的小溪上方开启了！路马向下望着翻滚的水面。“他在那儿！他在挣扎！”莱德保持着冷静。“记住我们的训练，狗狗们。先伸手，再投掷，然后划船，最后再下水！”

路马降落在泥泞的岸边。他没有立刻跳下去，因为水流太危险了。首先，他尝试用长树枝去够杰克，然后扔出了救生圈。最后，他不得不开着气垫船划进波浪中。他抓住了杰克脖子后面厚实的皮，稳稳地把他拉上了甲板。“接到他了！”路马欢呼道。| The portal opened right over the roaring creek! Zuma looked down at the swirling water. "There he is! He's struggling!" Ryder stayed calm. "Remember our training, pups. Reach, Throw, Row, then Go!"

Zuma landed on the muddy bank. He didn't jump in yet because the water was too dangerous. First, he tried to Reach with a long branch, then he Threw a life-ring. Finally, he had to Row his hovercraft into the waves. He grabbed Jack by the scruff—the thick skin on his neck—and pulled him safely onto the deck. "Got him!" Zuma cheered. |

## Page 4 - The Science of Warmth / 温暖的科学

### Visual: Back on the bank, Jack is safe but shivering violently. Marshall has his med-kit open

|----------|------------|
|杰克安全地回到了草地上，但他全身都在剧烈发抖。“他在打冷颤！”毛毛喊道。“那是他的身体在尝试产生热量，因为他太冷了。”毛毛懂得科学：杰克患了失温症，这意味着他的能量非常低。

毛毛没有使用魔法加热器。他使用了主动擦干的方法，用厚毛巾擦掉杰克皮肤上的水。然后，他用一张闪亮的急救毯把杰克裹了起来。“这张毯子能把杰克自己的体温反射回他身上，”毛毛解释说。很快，冷颤停止了，杰克的心跳再次变得强劲而平稳。| Jack was safe on the grass, but his whole body was shaking. "He's shivering!" Marshall cried. "That's his body trying to make heat because he's too cold." Marshall knew the science: Jack had Hypothermia, which means his energy was very low.

Marshall didn't use a magic heater. He used active drying to rub the water off Jack's skin with thick towels. Then, he wrapped Jack in a shiny space blanket. "This blanket reflects Jack's own body heat back to him," Marshall explained. Soon, the shivering stopped, and Jack's heart beat strong and steady again. |

|即使营救成功，大草原依然漆黑一片，大篷车也已经走远了。“别担心，杰克，包在我身上！”阿奇叫道。他使用高科技无人机追踪泥泞中的车轮印。狗狗们陪着杰克在低语的长草丛中走了好几英里。他们保护他远离阴影，并在他感到疲惫时不断为他加油。“再走一点点就到了，勇敢的小狗！”天天轻声说。“你的家人正在等你。”| Even after the rescue, the prairie was dark and the wagon was far away. "Don't worry, Jack, I'm on the case!" Chase barked. He used his high-tech drone to track the wagon wheels in the mud. The pups walked with Jack for miles through the tall, whispering grass. They kept him safe from the shadows and cheered him on whenever he felt tired. "Just a little further, brave pup!" Skye whispered. "Your family is waiting." |

## Page 6 - The Secret Goodbye / 秘密告别

### Visual: The glowing portal is humming as the pups prepare to leave. Ryder kneels to pat Jack one last time

| 🇨🇳 中文 | 🇬🇧 English |
|----------|------------|
|在营地的边缘，是时候告别了。杰克温暖地舔了舔莱德的手，表示“谢谢”。莱德笑了。“记住，杰克，这次冒险是我们的秘密！你绝不能告诉人类你见过我们。”当狗狗们走进闪光的传送门时，他们忍不住发出了最后一声欢快的嚎叫。嗷呜——！ 那是一声响亮而快乐的声音，在大草原的夜空中回荡，一直传向遥远的未来。| At the edge of the camp, it was time to say goodbye. Jack gave Ryder a warm lick on the hand to say "Thank you." Ryder smiled. "Remember, Jack, this adventure is our secret! You must never tell the humans you saw us." As the pups stepped into the glowing portal, they couldn't help but give one final, joyful howl. Awoooo! It was a loud, happy sound that echoed across the dark prairie and all the way into the future. |

## Page 7 - Back to the Firelight / 回到火光中

### Visual: The campfire glows bright against the dark prairie. Pa stands alert with his gun, looking into the shadows. Jack is just visible at the edge of the light, mud-caked and tired, his tail starting to wag as he sees his family

| 🇨🇳 中文 | 🇬🇧 English |
|----------|------------|
|一声悠长而哀婉的嚎叫声飘过漆黑的大草原。“是狼，”爸爸说着，伸手去拿他的枪保护家人。他不知道那是秘密朋友们告别的声音。突然，劳拉大叫道：“瞧，爸爸！是狼！”黑暗中闪烁着两道绿光，正向营火越爬越近。爸爸举好枪，注视着阴影。

但那并不是狼。当那个动物来到火光边缘时，劳拉高兴地尖叫起来！是杰克！他浑身糊满了泥巴，眼睛因为长途跋涉而发红，但他回家了。杰克连蹦带跳，舔着劳拉的手和脸。他最后一次望向黑暗的大草原，记着他的秘密诺言。杰克发出一声长长的、幸福的叹息，紧挨着劳拉躺下来，闭上了眼睛。终于，一切都圆满了。| A long, wailing howl drifted over the dark prairie. "Wolves," Pa said, reaching for his gun to protect the family. He didn't know it was the sound of secret friends saying goodbye. Suddenly, Laura shouted, "Look, Pa! A wolf!" Two green lights were shining in the dark, crawling closer and closer to the campfire. Pa held the gun ready, watching the shadows.

But it wasn't a wolf. As the animal reached the edge of the firelight, Laura screamed with joy! It was Jack! He was mud-caked and red-eyed from his long journey, but he was home. Jack leaped and wriggled, licking Laura's hands and face. He looked back once more into the dark prairie, remembering his secret promise. With a long, happy sigh, he lay down close to Laura and closed his eyes. At last, everything was right. |
